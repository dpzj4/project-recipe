    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>
        It's a recipe for chicken fajitas. Just go ahead and skip down to the <a href="#steps">cooking part</a> we dont have time to read this. But just cause every other recipe page does it, I'ma do it to. I am human I am not immune to peer pressure. Fajitas come in both steak and chicken flavors and other weird combos like fish and shrimp, and thats cool if you like that but its wrong. Chicken fajitas are where it's at. I mean not only because they are just quicker for me, but also because prep is just easier. I mean steak is definitely what everyone thinks of when anyone says fajitas but thats a specialty item where I'm at right now. Seeing as how chicken appears to be a readily available ingredient around the world, chicken wins by default. Unless you have a butcher who is able to slice skirt steak thinly, in which case I am envious and want a few pounds sent expeditiously.

        Chicken fajitas is one of those meals that just works. Taco tuesday, taco wednesday, taco thursday, it doesnt even have to be a taco. Fajitas are strong independent entree and they don't need no tortilla. But they do go very well together and it would honestly be a downgrade if not served together.
