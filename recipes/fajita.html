    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>
        The recipe says chicken fajitas but this really applies to both chicken or skirt steak. While I do love skirt steak chicken fajitas are just quicker for me. Not to mention how much easier the prep is. Unless you have a butcher who is able to slice skirt steak thinly, in which case I am envious and want a few pounds sent expeditiously.

        Chicken fajitas is one of those meals that just works. Taco tuesday, taco wednesday, taco thursday, it doesnt even have to be a taco. Fajitas are strong independent entree and they don't need no tortilla. But they do go very well together and it would honestly be a downgrade if not served together.
