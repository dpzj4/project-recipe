    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>
        This recipe comes from my love of eating at random spots. Originally sourced from a small shop named Figo located in Old 4th Ward, this meal didn't imprint upon me until after the pandemic when the shop closed down. Following that, I was left without a quick and decent pasta place. However as luck would have it, I encountered the shops new form after covid restrictions started easing up in Atlanta. It was hard to spot at first since it downsized into a food truck parked a few blocks away from little 5 points. Regardless, this pasta spot has now has become a mandatory stop whenever we're looking for a quick meal or just whenever we are in the area.

        Although my orders vary based on mood or cravings, Penne Arrabbiata is always surefire. With some extra roma tomato and fresh spinach and basil, this recipe is simple enough to elevate even the laziest of fuckit pasta nights. (fuckit pasta being the phrase uttered after giving up on cooking plans and just settling on pasta)

    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>(1) Box of Penne (or pasta of your choosing)</li>
        <li>(2) 28oz cans of whole peeled tomatos</li>
        <li>(1) small onion diced</li>
        <li>(6) cloves garlic diced</li>
        <li>(2 tbsp) crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>(4 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>(1/4 cup) of fresh chopped basil</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour oil into a pot and heat on medium heat. Add onions and cook until lightly transparent. Add garlic and pepper flakes and cook about 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Add tomatos to pot. Crush tomatos and adjust heat to a strong simmer.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot bring water to a boil. Add a teaspoon of table salt.(use the recommended amount of water listed on your pasta packaging) </li>
        <li>Add pasta to boiling water and cook until al dente. (refer to packaging for specific instructions)</li>
        <li>Crush tomatos until chunky texture. Further simmer until desired consistency is acheived. Add basil, salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once the sauce has reached your ideal consistency you can plate the pasta and scoop the sauce on top for a neat presentation, or if you are like me, you can just go ahead and mix the pasta into the sauce so that you have a uniform distribution of sauce to noodle.</p>
