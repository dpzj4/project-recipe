    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>
        This one is a bit of an experiment born out of necessity and familiarity. Weird combination honestly. The backstory is tragic, be prepared... Midway through 2022 we moved out of the country for a job opportunity. News like that is amazing and surprising, I mean who wouldn't want to hear that offer being presented to them? That's the thinking that preceded the move all the way up until the day we left to Japan. Excitement and curiosity mixed with nerves and anticipation dominated every thought and every available neuron until our arrival. However due to the nature of this move, relaxation was not to be enjoyed until about a month after our disembarkment as we had to undergo the fastest processing and relocation I have ever been witness to. So, halfway around the world and a whole five weeks later I am standing in our new kitchen after the most sobering grocery store trip with a realization that took weeks in the making. Torillas dont exist here as I know them. See? Tragic. I am Mexican. According to my wife we Mexicans eat two things without fail, sweet bread in the mornings and tortillas with everything. To be halfway across the world without my tortilla press or precisely 1 Pacific Ocean away from the nearest pack of Maseca is something that all the anticipation and excitement clouded out of my minds eye.

        But I did mention I am Mexican. This is where the ingenuity comes in. In a moment of clarity and due to sheer necessity I had an idea. Taking a page from my Filipino brothers I got a pack of Lumpia wraps and created opportunity where there was only hunger and desire. You see, lumpia is what we commonly know as eggroll wrap. Which if used outside of its recommended manufacturers specifications can easily double as a very thin tortilla. If you squint and tilt your head and use several doses of imagination. It works, I promise. I mean, youre reading this so maybe the recipe did work. It's ok, I know youre not reading this. You already skipped down to the ingredient list to see what kind of monstrosity I created. Its cool. I do the same thing too. Thank you if you did make it this far. Let's cook.
