    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>
        Much like the Arrabbiata recipe this one comes from my appreciation for pasta and from an unexpected source. Up until my early 30s I had never really ventured outside red sauce pasta, I don't really know why. It wasn't until my sister had a foreign exchange student that I was introduced to the beautiful simplicity of pesto. I had heard of it and I had seen it plenty of times in restaurant menus but I had almost always chosen either an olive oil pasta or my go-to red sauce pasta. It wasnt until the Italian foreign exchange student showed me the simplest pesto recipe that I realized what I had been missing this whole time.

        It took me one serving to immediately add pesto to my secret green list of favored foods. But what cemented it into that list was definitely the feeling of family that came with eating it during the time period when it was available to me. In short, it became a comfort food. Evoking memories of meals at my sisters house that turned from a chat and a quick bite after work to whole plates and a full conversations. It was definitely one of those things that turned into a something special and meaningful without knowing. What was once an after work meal has turned into my most prized comfort food. In part due to its simplicty and in more parts because of how it reminds me of a special and simpler time.
